    <h1>Don "Max" Carlo</h1>
    <p>I was born in Seattle on February 10th, 1998. Shortly there after, my
    family moved to Bellevue and we've been here ever since. I just
    graduated from Sammamish High School where I developed an interest in
    programming through an introduction to robotics course. I now attend a
    coding school called 'Code Fellows' and I am hoping to land a job as a
    JavaScript developer. I love solving problems, and I am not satisfied with
    anything less than perfection. On the weekends I enjoy going to church,
    and I would never want to compromise God for anything else.</p>
